# CityDistanceCalculator

## Description
This Java program calculates the distance between two cities (Dallas, Austin, Houston, Galveston) by using a two-dimensional array that stores the distances between the cities. The user selects the starting and ending city, and the program returns the distance in miles. This project demonstrates the use of arrays, switch-case statements, and user input handling in Java.

## Requirements
- Java 21.0.2 or later

## Usage
To run the program, compile the `DistanceCities.java` file and execute it. The user will be prompted to input the starting and ending cities, and the program will display the distance between the selected cities.

### Example Output
What is your starting city: Dallas, Austin, Houston, Galveston? Dallas What is your ending city: Houston, Austin, Dallas, Galveston? Houston Distance is 239 miles

### Cities Available:
- Dallas
- Austin
- Houston
- Galveston

### How It Works:
- The program uses a 2D array to store distances between the cities.
- Switch-case statements are used to match the user's city input to the corresponding index in the array.
- The program then retrieves and displays the distance between the selected cities.
